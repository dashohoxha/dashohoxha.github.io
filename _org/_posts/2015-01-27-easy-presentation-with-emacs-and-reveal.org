Recently I had to prepare a presentation for a workshop. I knew that
org-mode of Emacs could be used for presentations as well, but I
hadn't tried it yet. After some research, I decided to go with
[[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][org-reveal]], which can generate very nice online presentations.

I already had Emacs and org-mode installed. If you don't have
org-mode version 8.0 or later (check it with =M-x org-version=), you
should update it. You can do it like this:
 1. Go to the list of packages: =M-x package-list-packages=
 2. Find the package org: =C-s org=
 3. Go to it and press =<Enter>=
 4. Install it by clicking on =[Install]=

To install org-reval, we first get it from GitHub:
#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal.git
#+end_example
Then we need to copy ~ox-reveal.el~ to the org-mode installation
directory. In my case, I did it like this:
#+begin_example
cp org-reveal/ox-reveal.el ~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-20141124/
#+end_example

At the begining of the org file I set some REVEAL options like these:
#+begin_example

#+REVEAL_ROOT: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/2.5.0/
#+REVEAL-SLIDE-NUMBER: t
#+REVEAL_THEME: sky
#+REVEAL_TRANS: linear
#+end_example
You can also see how the whole org file looks like: [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dashohoxha/dashohoxha.github.io/master/github-website/github-website.org][github-website.org]]

To wake-up org-reveal, type =M-x load-library=, then type =ox-reveal=.
To export the org file into Reveal.js presentation, type =C-c C-e R R=.
The resulting HTML file looks like this: http://dashohoxha.fs.al/github-website/

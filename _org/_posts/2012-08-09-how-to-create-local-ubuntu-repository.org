title:      How to Create a Local Ubuntu Repository
date:       2012-08-09 02:49:00
summary:
    We have about 40 computers installed with Edubuntu, and more than a
    dozen of servers (most of them running on virtual machines). They
    all need to be updated time after time with the latest version of
    packages. Also, time after time, new packages need to be installed.
    These packages come from some central Ubuntu Repository servers.

    All this activity for keeping computers up-to-date (up to the latest
    version) consumes lots of bandwidth and takes a lot of time. And
    there are new package updates almost every day! For one computer
    this can be acceptable, however for lots of computers it may become
    unbearable.

    One solution for this problem is to create a local mirror of the
    ubuntu repository.

We have about 40 computers installed with Edubuntu, and more than a
dozen of servers (most of them running on virtual machines). They
all need to be updated time after time with the latest version of
packages. Also, time after time, new packages need to be installed.
These packages come from some central Ubuntu Repository servers.

All this activity for keeping computers up-to-date (up to the latest
version) consumes lots of bandwidth and takes a lot of time. And
there are new package updates almost every day! For one computer
this can be acceptable, however for lots of computers it may become
unbearable.

One solution for this problem is to create a local mirror of the
ubuntu repository.  

* Creating an APT Mirror

  Fortunately, creating a local mirror of the APT packages is very
  easy. There is even a tool that helps to create it, called
  =apt-mirror=. So, the first step is to install it:
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  aptitude install apt-mirror
  #+END_SRC

  The next step is to customize its configuration file,
  ~/etc/apt/mirror.list~. It should look like this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  set base_path    /data/apt-mirror
  set defaultarch  amd64
  set nthreads     5

  #+END_SRC

  The URL-s here are the same to what I have on
  ~/etc/apt/sources.list~ on my computers. I am storing the packages
  on the directory ~/data/apt-mirror~, which has plenty of free disk
  space (at least 200 GB). I am mirroring the packages for both
  *amd64* and *i386* architectures, and i am skipping the source
  packages (*deb-src*) to save some space.
   
  Now we can start making the mirror (or updating it) by running
  ~apt-mirror~.
  + Note :: If the mirroring process is interrupted, start it again
	    by typing ~apt-mirror~.  If it refuses to start (claiming
	    that it is already running), look out for
	    ~/data/apt-mirror/var/apt-mirror.lock~ and remove it.
  + Note :: Initially it can take a lot of time (several days) to
	    make a full mirror, depending on the speed of the network
	    connection.

  After mirroring is done, we can export the mirror by HTTP:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ln -s /data/apt-mirror/mirror /var/www/apt-mirror
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  Of course, /apache/ has to be already installed (~aptitude install
  apache2~).


* Configure clients for using the local repository

  In order to use this mirror from a client, modify
  ~/etc/apt/sources.list~ to use something like this
  ~http://192.168.10.50/apt-mirror/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/~
  instead of ~http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/~. It should look
  like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  #+END_EXAMPLE
  Here, =192.168.10.50= is the IP of the server where we have created
  the mirror.


* Keeping the APT mirror synchronized

  To synchronize our local repository with the central one, we can
  just run =apt-mirror= at any time. However I usually prefer to
  automate things, so I have created the script ~/etc/cron.daily/aptmirror~:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #!/bin/sh
  rm /data/apt-mirror/var/apt-mirror.lock
  /usr/bin/apt-mirror
  /data/apt-mirror/var/clean.sh
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  This will run automatically each day (during the night). Make sure
  that it is executable: =chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/aptmirror= .


* Doing release upgrade from our local ubuntu repository

  Once in a while (once in 6 months or so), Ubuntu makes new
  releases. It would be usefull if we can upgrade from our local APT
  mirror. However this needs some further steps to be taken.

  + First of all, get a local copy of /dist-upgrader/ files:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd /data/apt-mirror/mirror
    mkdir dist_upgrade
    cd dist_upgrade
    export dist_upgrader_url='http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/dist-upgrader-all/current'
    wget $dist_upgrader_url/precise.tar.gz
    wget $dist_upgrader_url/precise.tar.gz.gpg
    wget $dist_upgrader_url/ReleaseAnnouncement
    wget $dist_upgrader_url/ReleaseAnnouncement.html
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  + Get a local copy of the files /meta-release/ and
    /meta-release-lts/ as well:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd /data/apt-mirror/mirror/dist_upgrade/
    wget http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release
    wget http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release-lts
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  + Modify the URL-s in the file /meta-release/ to look like this:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Dist: oneiric
    Name: Oneiric Ocelot
    Version: 11.10
    Date: Thu, 13 Oct 2011 12:00:00 UTC
    Supported: 1
    Description: This is the 11.10 release
    Release-File: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/Release
    ReleaseNotes: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric-updates/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/ReleaseAnnouncement
    ReleaseNotesHtml: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric-updates/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/ReleaseAnnouncement.html
    UpgradeTool: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric-updates/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/oneiric.tar.gz
    UpgradeToolSignature: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric-updates/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/oneiric.tar.gz.gpg

    Dist: precise
    Name: Precise Pangolin
    Version: 12.04 LTS
    Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2012 12:04:00 UTC
    Supported: 1
    Description: This is the 12.04 LTS release
    Release-File: http://192.168.10.50/apt-mirror/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/Release
    ReleaseNotes: http://192.168.10.50/apt-mirror/dist_upgrade/ReleaseAnnouncement
    ReleaseNotesHtml: http://192.168.10.50/apt-mirror/dist_upgrade/ReleaseAnnouncement.html
    UpgradeTool: http://192.168.10.50/apt-mirror/dist_upgrade/precise.tar.gz
    UpgradeToolSignature: http://192.168.10.50/apt-mirror/dist_upgrade/precise.tar.gz.gpg
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    Do the same for the file /meta-release-lts/.

  + On each system that is to be upgraded install /update-manager-core/:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    aptitude install update-manager-core
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  + On each system that is to be upgraded modify the URL-s in the
    file ~/etc/update-manager/meta-release~ to look like this:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # default location for the meta-release file

    [METARELEASE]
    URI = http://192.168.10.50/apt-mirror/dist_upgrade/meta-release
    URI_LTS = http://192.168.10.50/apt-mirror/dist_upgrade/meta-release-lts
    URI_UNSTABLE_POSTFIX = -development
    URI_PROPOSED_POSTFIX = -proposed
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  + Run ~do-release-upgrade~ on the systems that should be
    upgraded. Now everything should be retrieved from the local
    mirror, without going out to the Internet.

  + *Note*: Make sure to comment out all lines starting with *deb-src*
    on ~/etc/apt/sources.list~ before starting the upgrade, since we
    have not retrieved the source packages in our local mirror.

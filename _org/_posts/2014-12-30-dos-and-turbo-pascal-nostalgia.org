Recently I made an "archaeological" discovery, I found an old game
that I have written almost 20 years ago in DOS. This is one of the
first programs that I have written, and it is also one of the most
beautiful ones that I have ever written. The computer can also play
against a human and it uses Artificial Intelligence (MiniMax algorithm
with alpha and beta pruning). I have written it during the summer
holidays of 1995 (in about 3 months). The code of this game is now on
GitHub: https://github.com/dashohoxha/reversi

I had already studied Computer Science for two years in the Faculty of
Natural Sciences in Tirana, Albania. During the first year we learned
lots of algorithms and data structures (and a lot of maths of course),
but we did very little programming practice. We didn't have personal
computers at home and the resources of the university were very
limited. There was a VAX VMS miniframe donated by a German university
and a room of black-and-white terminals (actually the colors were
black and green or black and yellow, or something like this). So, we
never had enough time to practice as much as we wanted, and we mostly
wrote our programs with paper and pencil, simulating the computer in
our heads.

During the second year a PC lab of about 10-20 computers was installed
in the university (again with some foreign help and donations) and we
started to write our programs in DOS with Turbo Pascal. But again we
couldn't get enough time to practice programming as much as we wanted
and to write the great programs that we wished.  We also didn't have
any good books about programming, there was no internet around yet, and
the quality of lectures was lacking. We mostly learned by trying
things ourselves and by helping each-other.  The older students were
helpful to us and we were always eager to help any younger students.

After the second year I got a scholarship for studying in Turkey.
Since I couldn't speak neither English nor Turkish at that time, I had
to spend the first year in the preparatory school, learning Turkish
and English. At the end of this year I had managed to save enough
money to by an i386 PC (or maybe it was i486, I am not sure). So, when
I went back home for the summer holidays, I had a PC with me, which I
could use as much as I wanted, day and night, without any limits or
constraints.

I hadn't written any serious programs yet, just small things and I was
not sure how useful my knowledge was. So, I decided to do something
challenging, just to test out myself and to learn new things. I
decided to write a game and further more I would try to make the
computer play the game. I had never seen a computer before going to
university, I didn't know exactly what it was like, but my opinion
about it was that it is an electronic machine that does intelligent
things. This is why I loved computer science and this is why I wished
to study it. So, I wanted to do something intelligent, something
clever. Later I got a bit disappointed from the "intelligence" of the
computers and from the artificial intelligence, but the computer
science was still beautiful.

I had an old textbook of algorithms and data structures, which
included also the minimax algorithm and its modifications for alpha
and beta pruning. The quality of the book was poor, it had typing
mistakes, the algorithm was iterative (not recursive) and difficult to
understand. However I worked hard and managed to understand and to
implement it correctly.

I spent lots of time for this program but I didn't mind sitting many
hours in front of the computer. From my two first years at the
university of Tirana I had developed a feeling of never having enough
time to practice, so now that I had my own computer I was trying to
take advantage of it as much as possible.

I don't know whether it can run on Windows, but it can run on Linux
with the help of *dosbox*:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo apt-get install dosbox
dosbox LP.EXE
#+END_EXAMPLE

It can also be possible to compile it with Free Pascal, but I haven't
tried it yet. Maybe one day I will try to rewrite this game in
JavaScript or Ruby or some other modern language. Or maybe somebody
else might help me for it.

Recently I made [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNCbEVVasto][this visualization]] for contributors to
https://l10n.org.al for the last two years (2012-2013). This
visualization was done with [[https://code.google.com/p/gource/][gource]]. It was a bit of hacking, so I
would like to describe here how I did it.

* Getting the data to be visualized

  For each translation or vote on https://l10n.org.al/ the time and
  the name of the author is saved as well. So, we would like to get
  this information from the database, as well as the project to which
  this translation belonged, for all votes and translations.

  First have a look at this diagram: [[https://github.com/B-Translator/B-Translator.github.io/raw/master/docs/uml/db_diagram.png][db_diagram.png]] just to get an
  idea of the structure of the database.

  [[https://github.com/B-Translator/B-Translator.github.io/raw/master/docs/uml/db_diagram.png][https://github.com/B-Translator/B-Translator.github.io/raw/master/docs/uml/db_diagram.png]]

  Then look at the script below which I used to extract the data.

  #+BEGIN_HTML
  {% highlight bash %}
  #!/bin/bash
  query="
    SELECT v.time, u.name, (v.time=t.time) AS new, project, origin
    FROM votes v
    LEFT JOIN users u ON (u.ulng = v.ulng AND u.umail = v.umail)
    LEFT JOIN translations t ON (t.tguid = v.tguid)
    LEFT JOIN strings s ON (s.sguid = t.sguid)
    LEFT JOIN locations l ON (l.sguid = s.sguid)
    LEFT JOIN templates tpl ON (tpl.potid = l.potid)
    LEFT JOIN projects p ON (p.pguid = tpl.pguid)
  "
  mysql -u root -D btranslator_data -B -e "$query" > contrib.txt
  {% endhighlight %}
  #+END_HTML

  This is simply a join of the tables and extracting the fields that
  are needed. When the time of vote is the same as the time of
  translation, then this is a new translation and the field =new= is
  true.


* Transforming data to the right format

  In the result file ~contrib.txt~ fields are separated by TAB, so
  first I replaced tabs with commas (,) for easy processing. I did it
  with find/replace on Emacs, but any other editor can do this.

  Gource expects the input file (which is called log file) in the
  format =timestamp|username|action|filename=. Gource was designed to
  work with version control systems (like git, subversion, etc.) in
  order to visualize the project activity, so the =action= is expected
  to be A, or M, or D etc. (respectively for adding, modifying,
  deleting a file) and =filename= is the file that was touched.

  I had to transform the data to this format and I did it with a script
  like this:
  #+BEGIN_HTML
  {% highlight bash %}
  #!/bin/bash

  while read l
  do
      time=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f1)
      name=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f2)
      new=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f3)
      project=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f4)
      origin=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f5)
      timestamp=$(date -d "$time" +%s)  # convert to timestamp
      if [ "$new" = "1" ]; then action='A'; else action='M'; fi
      path="/$origin/$project"
      echo "$timestamp|$name|$action|$path"
  done < contrib.txt > contrib.log  
  {% endhighlight %}
  #+END_HTML

  I also made sure that there are no lines containing NULL and that
  the file is sorted in increasing order by the timestamp:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sed -i contrib.log -e '/NULL/d'

  sort -t'|' -k1 contrib.log > contrib-1.log
  rm contrib.log
  mv contrib-1.log contrib.log
  #+END_EXAMPLE


* Feeding the data to gource and generating the output

  First make sure that the tools that we need are installed:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt-get install gource ffmpeg
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Then generate the video with a script like this:  
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #!/bin/bash

  gource contrib.log -s 0.1 -i 0 --max-files 0 \
         --date-format "%B %Y" --hide dirnames,filenames \
         -640x360 -o - \
    | ffmpeg -y -r 25 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - \
             -vcodec libvpx -b 10000K contrib.webm
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  How did I know that these are the right options? I didn't know
  (especially for =ffmpeg=), I simply googled and found some examples,
  then I played with some options of =gource= in order to get it
  right.

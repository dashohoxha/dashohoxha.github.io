Time after time I write technical blogs and articles that describe and
summarise my experiences. Nowadays all the blogging sites and tools
offer WYSIWYG editors.  And it makes blogging so easy, right? Not for
me! I always find WYSIWYG editing tedious and frustrating.


* Why WYSIWYG sucks

  One reason is that you have to make manually every single change (no
  styles like CSS for example), which makes the process tedious, error
  prone and inconsistent. If you decide later to change some styles,
  you have to go all over the document and modify all occurrences one
  by one... Oh man, better don't touch it at all!

  But the worst thing about WYSIWYG is that actually its last name is
  WYGIANWYW (What You Get Is Almost Never What You Want). I have
  struggled many times with the editor because it would never
  understand correctly what I wanted and would display a totally broken
  formatting (long live *undo* that comes quickly to the rescue).

  So, I'd rather write plain text HTML than use WYSIWYG editing,
  unless the structure and formatting of the document is very
  simple. Maybe not everybody finds WYSIWYG so difficult and annoying,
  but the technical blogs (articles, documents, etc.) that I write are
  a bit long and with complex structure, and WYSIWYG would never be
  suitable for me. I have also tried different wiki systems, which in
  a sense are better than WYSIWYG, but still they are a bit simple and
  do not support all the features that I need.


* Org-mode of Emacs

  After trying different tools and systems, I decided that the [[http://orgmode.org][orgmode]]
  of Emacs is the best for my needs. Quoting from its webpage:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  "Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning
  projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective
  plain-text system."
  #+END_QUOTE
  So, among other things, org-mode can be used for /authoring
  documents/, that is writing blogs, articles etc.

  It has a wiki-like syntax that is lightweight but also complex
  (not-simple). Combined with the editing power of Emacs it becomes a
  powerful tool for writing blogs, articles and other docs. Then, it
  can be converted automatically to other formats, like /HTML/,
  /LaTeX/, /PDF/, etc.

  I will try to describe how I use it for my needs (writing blogs,
  articles, etc.)


* Installing Emacs

  On Ubuntu it can be installed like this: =sudo apt-get install
  emacs= On other Linux systems it should be very easy too. If you are
  using Windows, then look at the instructions on this [[http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/pages/faculty/alee/emacs/emacs.html][page]].

  The latest versions of Emacs include org-mode by default, so there
  is no need to do anything special for installing it. Just use the
  extension *.org* for the file and the /org editing mode/ will be
  enabled automatically.


* Using org-mode for writing documents

  Emacs is an advanced editing tool and org-mode has lots of features,
  however not all of them are needed. For what we want to do (writing
  technical blogs and docs), we need some very basic and simple things.

  I will list the ones that I use most frequently:

  + Paragraphs are marked by empty lines:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Paragraph1
    Paragraph1 continued

    Paragraph2
    Paragraph2 continued
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  + Headings are marked by stars at the beginning of a line:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    * Heading1
    ** Heading2
    *** Heading3
    ** Heading2

    * Heading1
    ** Heading2
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  + Ordered and unordered lists:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      + item-1
        1. item-1.1
        2. item-1.2
        3. item-1.3
      + item-2
	- item-2.1
	- item-2.2
	- item-2.3
      + item-3
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    + item-1
      1. item-1.1
      2. item-1.2
      3. item-1.3
    + item-2
      - item-2.1
      - item-2.2
      - item-2.3
    + item-3

  + Inline markup:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and ~verbatim~
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and ~verbatim~

  + Hyperlink:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [[http://info.btranslator.org][B-Translator]]
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    [[http://info.btranslator.org][B-Translator]]

  + Preformatted:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Some example from a text file.
    # +END_EXAMPLE
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Some example from a text file.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  It is so simple, intuitive and familiar, that you don't even need a
  tutorial and can start using it right away.

  You can find more about the markup that can be used, on the
  [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Markup][documentation of org-mode]] (or try =info org= on the terminal).

  As an example, you can see the /org/ code of this document itself on
  gist: [[https://gist.github.com/dashohoxha/5981222][easy-blogging-with-emacs.org]]


* Publishing the document

  In order to publish the document, I do these steps:
  1. First, convert it to HTML (with the emacs command: =C-c C-e h=).
  2. Then open the generated HTML file in a browser.
  3. And then copy/paste the content of the article from the browser
     to the editor of the blog site.

  I don't know why, but a copy/paste like this usually works very
  well. I use [[http://dashohoxha.blogspot.com/][Blogger]] for my blogs, but I think that it should work on
  other blog sites and WYSIWYG editors as well.

  After the copy/paste, I still have to do some minor manual
  corrections, but this is much easier than writing the whole thing
  on the WYSIWYG editor.

  Pay attention to these lines that are at the beginning of the /org/
  file:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #+OPTIONS: num:nil toc:t ^:nil f:nil TeX:nil LaTeX:nil
  #+STYLE: <link href="css/org.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  They control the look of the generated HTML file. The first one
  defines some settings/options, like: don't number headers, generate
  a TOC, turn off TeX syntax for subscripts, etc. More details and
  other options you can find on the documentation for [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Export-settings][export settings]].
  
  The second line tells it which CSS file to use, so that the
  generated HTML looks nice and beautiful. For a quick start, just
  download and use my [[https://gist.github.com/dashohoxha/5980833][org.css]] file, and later you can customise it for
  yourself. For example, it defines the style of preformatted text like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
  {% highlight css %}
  pre {
	 padding: 10px;
	 border: 1pt solid #AEBDCC;
	 border-radius: 5px;
	 background-color: #000000;
	 color: #eeeeee;
	 font-family: Ubuntu Mono, monospace, courier;
  }
  {% endhighlight %}
  #+END_EXPORT
 

* Converting the document to PDF

  Org-mode can convert directly to PDF. However there is no way (as
  far as I know) to modify how the generated PDF file looks like.  It
  always has the same standard look of an old scientific paper (I
  guess that the conversion to PDF is done by converting first to
  LaTeX).

  I prefer to take another approach for generating PDF docs:
  1. First I generate the HTML file (where I can control how it looks
     by customising the CSS file).
  2. Then I copy/paste from the browser to LibreOffice (yes, this
     copy/paste works well too, preserving all the formatting and
     styles from HTML).
  3. Finally save it as PDF. LibreOffice has a built-in PDF converter.
  
  However, before the third step I do again some minor manual
  modifications. I also define styles for headings, preformatted text,
  text body, etc.

  One of the things that I change in LibreOffice/PDF document is the
  style of the preformatted text. In the HTML version it is white font
  on a black background, and this is good because it looks like a
  terminal. However PDF documents sometimes can be printed and that
  style doesn't look nice on paper (and also it would consume lots of
  ink), so I change it to black font on white background.

  To apply the new style on a preformatted text, I select it, then from
  the list of styles (on top-left) select "Clear formatting", then
  select the style "Preformatted Text". I have to do this for all the
  preformatted texts. I do the same thing for headings as well.

  In order to not re-define the styles for each document, I open an
  old document, replace its content with the new content, and then
  save it with a new name. This will ensure that the styles of the new
  document are the same as the styles of the old one. Maybe
  LibreOffice has some other means for defining the styles and using
  them on each document, but I am not so familiar with LibreOffice and
  this trick works anyway.

  If you want to use my styles, you can download the *.odt* document
  from [[http://academia.edu/4005672/Easy_Blogging_With_Emacs][here]] and use it as a template for your own docs.

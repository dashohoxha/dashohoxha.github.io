* Introduction

  [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] is a static web site generator written in Ruby. It can
  transform various text markups, using a templating language, into
  static html. The resulting site can be served by almost any web
  server without requiring additional components such as php. Jekyll
  is the tool used to produce Github's pages.

  [[http://org-mode.org/][Org-mode]] of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] is very convenient for all-around editing, from
  simple note taking to managing one's tasks and to writing
  fully-fledged articles (which can later be exported to LaTeX, for
  instance). Hence it feels just natural to write blogs and articles
  in org-mode (rather than in markdown or textile, which are the
  formats supported by Jekyll).

  This article shows how I set up my own blog site on GitHub, using
  the org-mode of Emacs for editing articles and [[https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/][HPSTR Jekyll Theme]]
  for displaying them.


* Jekyll

** Installing Jekyll and the HPSTR theme

   + Fork the [[https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/fork][HPSTR Jekyll Theme]] repo and rename it to something like
     this: =username.github.io= (where =username= is your GitHub
     username). Alternatively, you can [[https://github.com/dashohoxha/dashohoxha.github.io/fork][fork the repo of my website]].

   + Make a local clone of your website repo:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     sudo apt-get install git
     git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   + Install Ruby and Bundler:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev
     sudo gem install bundler
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   + Install Jekyll and all dependencies:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     cd username.github.io/
     bundle install
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   + Test it locally:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     bundle exec jekyll serve
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     Now open in browser: http://localhost:4000


** Customizing the HPSTR theme

   Edit ~_config.yml~ to personalize your site. Most of the variables
   found here are used in the .html files found in ~_includes/~ (if you
   need to add or remove anything).

   Check out the sample posts in ~_posts/~ to see examples for pulling
   in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other
   YAML data.

   For more details about customizing the theme see:
   http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/theme-setup/


** Uploading your website to GitHub

   Since it is a git repository, we can commit our changes and push
   them to GitHub with =git push origin master=. In a few moments our
   changes will be available online and we can access it at
   http://username.github.io. However we should make sure first that
   the URL of the site on ~_config.yml~ is correct. It should be like
   this: =url: http://username.github.io=, not empty or =url:
   http://localhost:4000=, which are used for local development.
   
   Here are a few tips that can be useful during development:

   + *Tip1:* Everytime that you make a =git push origin master=, you
     have to give the github username and password. To avoid this, you
     can modify the file ~.git/config~ like this:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     [remote "origin"]
	     url = https://username:password@github.com/usename/username.github.io
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     (adding *username:password@* before /github.com/).

   + *Tip2:* Since the line =url:= in ~_config.yml~ has to be different
     for the online and local copy of the website, I have created a git
     branch named *local* where I do the development and testing, and
     then *cherry-pick* commits to the branch master and push them to
     github.

   + *Tip3:* To automate the workflow on the previous tip I use the script
     ~push.sh~ with a content like this:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #!/bin/bash

     ### get the parameter commit
     if [ "$1" = '' ]
     then
	 echo "Usage: $0 <commit_id>"
	 exit 1
     fi
     commit=$1

     ### transfer the commit to branch gh-pages
     git stash
     git checkout master
     git cherry-pick $commit

     ### push to github gh-pages
     git push origin master

     ### switch back to the local branch
     git checkout local
     git stash pop
     #+END_EXAMPLE


** Posting articles

   Jekyll expects the posted articles to be on the directory ~_posts/~,
   with a file name like ~yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-the-article.extension~.
   They can be in [[http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html][markdown]] or [[http://redcloth.org/textile][textile]] format and jekyll will convert
   them to HTML. But they can also be just plain HTML and jekyll will
   not touch their content. The extension can be ~.markdown~ (or
   ~.md~), ~.textile~, or ~.html~.

   In each case jekyll expects a /front-matter/ in YAML format at the
   very top of each file, which looks like this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ---
   layout:     post
   title:      Building a Technical Blog Site With Jekyll And Emacs
   date:       2014-12-13
   summary:    This article shows how I set up my own blog site on GitHub,
       using the org-mode of Emacs for editing articles and HPSTR Jekyll Theme
       for displaying them.
   tags: [Jekyll, Emacs, org-mode, Blogging]
   ---
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   It defines the layout (from directory ~_layouts/~) that will be used
   to render the article and other variables that are used in the
   templates.


** Customizing CSS

   To customize CSS, I added this line on ~assets/css/main.scss~:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   @import "custom";
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
   Then created the file ~_sass/_custom.scss~ with a content like this:
   #+BEGIN_HTML
   {% highlight css %}
   // Change the colors of the selected text.
   ::-moz-selection { 
	   background-color: blue;
	   color: white; 
	   text-shadow: none; 
   }  	
   ::selection { 
	   background-color: blue;
	   color: white; 
	   text-shadow: none; 
   }

   // Decrease the space between the links in the section About.
   #dl-menu .dl-submenu li a {
       padding: 10px 20px;
   }

   // Improve the display of figures by adding borders, centering, etc.
   .figure {
       text-align: center;
       border: 1px solid #eeeeee;
       margin: 20px 0;
   }
   .figure img {
       border: 1px solid #cccccc;
       border-radius: 5px;
       box-shadow: 0 0 10px #cccccc;
   }
   .figure p:nth-child(2) {
       background-color: #eeeeee;
       margin: 0;
   }
   .figure .figure-number {
       font-style: italic;
   }
   {% endhighlight %}
   #+END_HTML

   Of course you will need to make your own customizations.


* Org-mode

** Using org-mode for creating and editing articles

   I have created the directory ~_org/_posts/~ for the articles in
   org-mode format. The filename of an article looks like this:
   ~2014-12-13-building-technical-blog-site-with-jekyll-and-emacs.org~.

   The content of the article looks like this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

      http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html


** Converting org-mode articles to HTML format

   We need to export (convert) org-mode articles to HTML format and to
   place the HTML article in the directory ~_posts/~, so that it can be
   found and processed by Jekyll. We do this by defining an org-mode
   /publish project/ in the file *~/.emacs*, with a content like this:
   #+BEGIN_HTML
   {% highlight lisp %}
   (setq org-publish-project-alist '(

     ("org-blog"
	     ;; Path to your org files.
	     :base-directory "~/username.github.io/_org/"
	     :base-extension "org"

	     ;; Path to your Jekyll project.
	     :publishing-directory "~/username.github.io/"
	     :recursive t
	     :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
	     :headline-levels 4
	     :html-extension "html"
	     :body-only t ;; Only export section between <body> </body>
	     :section-numbers nil
	     :with-toc nil
       )

       ("org-static-blog"
	     :base-directory "~/username.github.io/_org/"
	     :base-extension any
	     :exclude ".*\.org"
	     :publishing-directory "~/username.github.io/"
	     :recursive t
	     :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

       ("blog" :components ("org-blog" "org-static-blog"))

   ))
   {% endhighlight %}
   #+END_HTML

   The first project ("org-blog") defines how the org files are
   published.  =:base-directory ~/username.github.io/_org/= is the
   directory that will be searched recursively for =.org= files. They
   will be converted to html with =:publishing-function
   org-html-publish-to-html= and will be saved to
   =:publishing-directory ~/username.github.io/= with the same
   directory structure.

   The setting =:body-only t= makes sure that only the body of the HTML
   document will be exported (the rest of the webpage will be
   constructed by jekyll according to the layout given in the config
   section).

   The second project ("org-static-blog") just copies anything else
   from the ~_org/~ directory to the main jekyll directory. They can be
   images, css/js files, etc.

   The project "blog" calls both of these publishing projects.
   
   Now we can export the project with =C-c C-e P x blog=.

   *Note:* If you don't have org-mode version 8.0 or later (check it
   with =M-x org-version=), you should update it. You can do it like
   this:
    1. Go to the list of packages: =M-x package-list-packages=
    2. Find the package *org*:  =C-s org=
    3. Go to it and press =<Enter>=
    4. Install it by clicking on =[Install]=


** Generating a TOC for an article

   Let us look closer at the export settings on the org file:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+OPTIONS:   H:3 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
   #+OPTIONS:   TeX:nil LaTeX:nil skip:nil d:nil todo:t pri:nil tags:not-in-toc
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   We notice the option =toc:t= which tells the export function to generate
   a /Table Of Content/ on the HTML file (to disable it use =toc:nil=).

   However there is a problem because the TOC is generated before
   anything else, even before the YAML config section. We don't want
   this because jekyll can process the config section of an HTML file
   only if it is at the top of the file.

   But we can fix it with commands like this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   (sed -n -e '/^---$/,/^---$/p' file.html; sed -e '/^---$/,/^---$/d' file.html) > file.new
   mv file.new file.html
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   (More on it later.)

   Now the TOC is displayed at the top of the article. However it is
   possible to make it look more nice and professional. Add these lines
   at the file ~_sass/_custom.scss~ and you will see that they create
   the splendid efect of a dynamic TOC:
   #+BEGIN_HTML
   {% highlight css %}
   // TOC copied from: http://orgmode.org/worg/
   #table-of-contents {
       font-size: 10pt;
       position: fixed;
       right: 0em;
       top: 0em;
       background: white;
       line-height: 12pt;
       text-align: right;
       box-shadow: 0 0 1em #777777;
       -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1em #777777;
       -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1em #777777;
       -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius: 5px;
       -moz-border-radius-bottomleft: 5px;
       /* ensure doesn't flow off the screen when expanded */
       max-height: 80%;
       overflow: auto;
   }
   #table-of-contents h2 {
       font-size: 13pt;
       max-width: 9em;
       border: 0;
       font-weight: normal;
       padding-left: 0.5em;
       padding-right: 0.5em;
       padding-top: 0.05em;
       padding-bottom: 0.05em;
   }
   #table-of-contents #text-table-of-contents {
       display: none;
       text-align: left;
   }
   #table-of-contents:hover #text-table-of-contents {
       display: block;
       padding: 0.5em;
       margin-top: -1.5em;
   }
   {% endhighlight %}
   #+END_HTML


** Displaying images properly

   Images in the org-mode file are included like this:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+CAPTION:    Tables and their relations.
   #+NAME:       fig:db_diagram
   #+ATTR_LaTeX: width=13cm
   [[file:images/btranslator-project/db_diagram.png][file:images/btranslator-project/db_diagram.png] ]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   On the final document it looks like this:
   #+CAPTION:    Tables and their relations.
   #+NAME:       fig:db_diagram
   #+ATTR_LaTeX: width=13cm
   [[file:images/btranslator-project/db_diagram.png][file:images/btranslator-project/db_diagram.png]]

   The image itself is initially placed on the directory
   ~/_org/images/btranslator_project/~. When the export comand is
   executed, besides converting to HTML it will also copy everything on
   the directory ~/_org/~ to the main directory of jekyll, so it will go
   to ~/images/btranslator_project/~. However the source of the image on
   the generated HTML file will look like this:
   #+BEGIN_HTML
   {% highlight html %}
   <img src="images/btranslator_project/db_diagram.png" />
   {% endhighlight %}
   #+END_HTML

   It is missing a slash (/) in front. It can be corrected after
   exporting with a command like this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   sed -e 's|="images/|="/images/|g' -i file.html
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   
** Post-processing html exports

   I have created a bash script for fixing the problems in the two
   sections above (making sure that the YAML section is at the very
   top of the generated HTML file, and correcting the URL of images).
   It is in the file ~_org/post-process.sh~ and looks like this:
   #+BEGIN_HTML
   {% highlight bash %}
   #!/bin/bash
   ### Post-process .html files (after being converted from .org)
   ### to make sure that they are properly formatted for jekyll.
   ### Example:
   ###     ./post-process.sh ../_posts/*.html

   ### if there are no argument, display the usage
   if [ $# -eq 0 ]
   then
       echo "
   Usage: $0 [<file>|<glob>]...

   Example:
       ./post-process.sh ../_posts/*.html
   "
       exit 1
   fi

   ### process each file given as an argument
   for file in $@
   do
       echo $file

       ### make sure that the yaml front matter is on top of the file
       (sed -n -e '/^---$/,/^---$/p' $file; sed -e '/^---$/,/^---$/d' $file) > $file.new
       mv $file.new $file

       ### fix the path (url) of images by adding a slash (/) in front of it
       sed -i $file -e 's|="images/|="/images/|g'
   done
   {% endhighlight %}
   #+END_HTML

   To make sure that all the HTML posts are OK, I call it like this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   _org/post_process.sh _posts/*.html
   #+END_EXAMPLE 
   It is also idempotent (runing it multiple times on the same HTML
   file will not break it).


** Higlighting the syntax of the code examples

   My articles often include code examples, so I am interested in
   displaying them prettily. I use the tags =#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE= and
   =#+END_EXAMPLE= to display terminal commands and output, and
   sometimes even for code, but it does not do syntax highlighting.

   For syntax highlighting I let jekyll do it, using the tags
   ={ % highlight %}= and ={ % endhighlight %}=, like this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+BEGIN_HTML
   { % highlight bash %}
   #!/bin/bash

   . . . . . . . . . . .

   { % endhighlight %}
   #+END_HTML
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   Of course it has to be wrapped in org tags =#+BEGIN_HTML= and
   =#+END_HTML=, so that it is copied verbatim while exporting to HTML.

   For other tips about code examples see also this:

<h2 id="org06e89bf">What is GnuPG</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard)</b> is a complete and free implementation of
the <b>OpenPGP</b> standard. It allows you to encrypt and sign your data
and communications.</li>

<li><b>GnuPG</b> has <span class="underline">scads of options</span> which make it a <span class="underline">flexible</span> and <span class="underline">powerful</span>
encryption framework. However this also makes it <span class="underline">extremely
complicated</span> to get started with, and that quite reasonably puts
people off.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orgeec075f">
<h3 id="orgeec075f">GnuPG is difficult</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have tried to use GnuPG since a long time ago, spent a lot of
time reading detailed and complicated tutorials, manuals etc. and
still I find myself lost when trying to use GnuPG.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-org49080d4">
<h3 id="org49080d4">Problems with GnuPG (in my opinion)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <b>gpg</b> command is monolithic, bloated with functionality and options.</li>
<li>The docs are not clearly structured.</li>
<li>The number of commands and options is huge.</li>
<li>There is no clear distinction between the commands and the options.</li>

<h2 id="org8854b2c">EasyGnuPG is opinionated</h2>
<ul>
<li>In order to simplify things, <b>EasyGnuPG</b> is opinionated about the
"right" way to use GnuPG. This means that while <b>GPG</b> offers lots of
options and flexibility to perform a certain task, <b>EGPG</b> uses just
a sensible default way, in order to keep things simple and not to
bewilder the user with countless choices.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org6c5e2b9">
<h3 id="org6c5e2b9">EasyGnuPG is opinionated</h3>
<ul>
<li>For example, when you create a new key in GPG you have to specify
a lot of options, most of which make no sense for a beginner, so
they will just use the defaults anyway.</li>
<li>EGPG on the other hand, just asks for a name and an email address,
filling up the rest with reasonable default values.</li>
<li>Not only that, but it also goes on and generates automatically the
needed subkeys, according to well known recommendations and best
practices of using GPG.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org39c2bc0">
<h3 id="org39c2bc0">EasyGnuPG is opinionated</h3>
<ul>
<li>Or, when encrypting a file, it also automatically signs it,
encrypts it to the author as well, and generates the output in the
text format (ASCII armored), which is more universal than the
binary format.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org105540a">
<h3 id="org105540a">EasyGnuPG is opinionated</h3>
<ul>
<li>This simplicity makes it easier for the beginners to get started.</li>
<li>At the same time, the selected subset of operations and features
covers most of the common cases of usage, so hopefully it should
be sufficient for the everyday needs of most of the users.</li>

<h2 id="org8b58293">EGPG integrates seamlessly with GPG</h2>
<ul>
<li>In case users need to use some advanced features or commands which
are not supported by EGPG, they can go on and use GPG itself at
any time, because EGPG also integrates seamlessly with GPG.</li>
<li>So, the reduced set of supported operations and features, while
being convenient for everyday usage, does not limit or prevent
users for doing more advanced or complex things.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orga7b9593">
<h3 id="orga7b9593">EGPG integrates seamlessly with GPG</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
For example, if you want to do some extra editing to the key,
which can't be done with EGPG due to its limited set of
functionality, you can do it like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
egpg gpg --edit-key 562AC309C01D2DBD
</pre>
<p>
Running <code>gpg</code> as a subcommand of <code>egpg</code> will ensure
that it uses the same environment (<code>GNUPGHOME</code>) as <code>egpg</code>.
</p></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org357ac3e">
<h3 id="org357ac3e">EGPG integrates seamlessly with GPG</h3>
<ul>
<li>Also, when initiating a new EGPG environment (with <code>egpg init</code>), you
can migrate all the data from an existing GPG or EGPG environment
(with <code>egpg migrate</code>).</li>
<li>Or you can fetch (pick up) only certain keys or contacts (public keys).</li>
<li><p>
For example:
</p>
<pre class="example">
egpg key fetch -k 01D532A283DC1CBF
egpg contact fetch 01D532A283DC1CBF
</pre></li>

<h2 id="orga14c837">EGPG has a clear and intuitive terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of the things that confuses people while using GPG is the
overloaded and unclear terminology about keys, about signatures,
etc.</li>
<li>EGPG tries to improve this by making a clear distinction between
the private keys and the public keys.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0cc5bad">
<h3 id="org0cc5bad">EGPG has a clear and intuitive terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li>In EGPG there is only one primary <b>key</b>, which is used for
signing, and a subkey which is used for decryption.</li>
<li>All the public keys are called <b>contacts</b>, since they contain the
names and email addresses of the people that you use to
communicate (either send them encrypted messages or verify their
signatures).</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgeaf7ce7">
<h3 id="orgeaf7ce7">EGPG has a clear and intuitive terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you say <b>public key</b> to a beginner, you will also have to
explain to him some cryptographic details and how public keys
should be used.</li>
<li>But if you say <b>contact</b> everybody gets that it contains details
that enable and facilitate communication.</li>
<li>Also, it makes more sense when you certify and trust a contact,
rather than editing a key and changing its certification and trust
levels.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-org58f5825">
<h2 id="org58f5825">EGPG is transparent and auditable</h2>
<ul>
<li>Being built as a set of shell scripts, EGPG is quite transparent
and auditable (different from a GUI for example, or a web
service).</li>
<li>If you are concerned about what it does, open up the files and
read them, or have someone you trust read them.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0fb5205">
<h3 id="org0fb5205">EGPG is transparent and auditable</h3>
<ul>
<li>The size of the main script is less than 250 lines, well within
the reach of most of the users.</li>
<li>Most of the commands are implemented on their own script, and
these scripts are about 50 lines long on average.</li>

<h2 id="orgcf679a5">EGPG commands</h2>
<ul>
<li>The set of commands and options of EGPG is well structured and
intuitive.  There are commands for:
<ul>
<li>working with files (for signing and encryption)</li>
<li>managing the key</li>
<li>managing contacts</li>
<li>other extra commands</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1f82910">
<h3 id="org1f82910">EGPG file commands</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
The commands for working with files are these:
</p>
<pre class="example">
egpg seal &lt;file&gt; [&lt;recipient&gt;...]
    Sign and encrypt a file. The resulting file will have the
    extension '.sealed'. The original file will be erased.

egpg open &lt;file.sealed&gt;
    Decrypt and verify the signature of the given file.
    The file has to end with '.sealed' and the output will have
    that extension stripped.

egpg sign &lt;file&gt;
    Sign a file. The signature will be saved to &lt;file.signature&gt;.

egpg verify &lt;file.signature&gt;
    Verify the signature. The signed file must be present as well.
</pre></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org13b81b3">
<h3 id="org13b81b3">EGPG key commands</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are commands to:
<ul>
<li>generate a new key or fetch an existing one</li>
<li>to backup and restore the key</li>
<li>to split and join the key</li>
<li>to generate a revocation certificate</li>
<li>to revoke the key</li>
<li>to delete the key</li>

<section id="slide-orga4973a9">
<h3 id="orga4973a9">EGPG contact commands</h3>
<ul>
<li>The commands about contacts include:
<ul>
<li>commands to search and receive contacts from the keyserver
network</li>
<li>to export and import from files</li>
<li>to fetch from existing GPG/EGPG directories</li>
<li>to certify and trust</li>

<section id="slide-org7917dd9">
<h2 id="org7917dd9">Managing the keys</h2>
<ul>
<li>To keep things simple, EGPG supports only one private key per
directory.</li>
<li>But there are ways to use several keys if needed.  For example it
can be done by using several EGPG directories/configurations,
which can work in parallel and independently of each-other.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orga73fd47">
<h3 id="orga73fd47">Managing the keys</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a design decision and is on purpose, not only for
simplicity, but also because when you need more than one key, you
usually use them in different contexts. So, it makes more sense to
keep and manage them separately and independently of each-other,
which could also help to avoid any confusion or mistakes when
using them.</li>

</ul>

<section>
<section id="slide-orgfacbdd9">
<h2 id="orgfacbdd9">EGPG extends the features of GPG</h2>
<ul>
<li>EGPG combines the features of GPG with external tools/commands in
order to achieve better results or to be more user-friendly.</li>

<li>For example, when making the backup of the key, the output is
produced as a PDF file with a 2D barcode, which can be printed on
paper and stored away on a safe place. Later this can be easily
scanned back to digital format and restored.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgc5daaac">
<h3 id="orgc5daaac">EGPG extends the features of GPG</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is achieved by exporting the key from GPG in ASCII armor
format, then using a bunch of Linux commands and tools, like
qrencode and convert, to convert it to the proper PDF format.</li>

<li>There is nothing that cannot be done manually or with a shell
script, but EGPG already automates things for you in a single
command, so that you can immediately take advantage of best
practices and recommendations.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org489a223">
<h3 id="org489a223">EGPG extends the features of GPG</h3>
<ul>
<li>Another example is printing the fingerprint of the key as a 2D
barcode and picking it up from the camera.</li>
<li>This can simplify the exchange of keys in mobile phones, if people
have physical contact.</li>
<li>For example in a meeting (one of them can show the code on the
screen, and the other one can scan it from the camera, and
automatically fetch the details from a keyserver).</li>
<li>Or it can be printed and scaned from a business card.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0827bbf">
<h3 id="org0827bbf">EGPG extends the features of GPG</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yet another example is moving the main key (that is used for
signing and certification) to a dongle (USB flash drive), for
portability and security (the USB flash drive should be
encrypted).</li>
<li><p>
This is done with the external command:
</p>
<pre class="example">
egpg key2dongle
</pre></li>

</ul>

<section>
<section id="slide-orgd15c45a">
<h2 id="orgd15c45a">Splitting the key</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can split a key into 3 partial keys, so that any 2 of them can
be combined to recreate the original key (but a single one is not
enough).</li>
<li>EGPG takes advantage of this to save a partial key on the local
machine and another partial on a dongle (USB flash drive,
removable device).</li>
<li>The third partial key is used as a backup, to recover the full key
in case that the dongle or the computer is lost, and it can be
stored for example on a cloud account.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org17ef8b1">
<h3 id="org17ef8b1">Splitting the key</h3>
<ul>
<li>Splitting the key into partial keys makes key management safer and
more robust.</li>
<li>In case that you loose the dongle the key is not deconspired,
because a single partial key is not enough to reconstruct the full
key.</li>
<li>The same goes for the backup partial key; you can store it on
cloud and if somebody manages to get it, they still cannot get
your key.</li>
<li>Similarly, if you loose the dongle or change the PC, you still can
recover the key using the remaining partial key and the backup
partial key.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org5e8875e">
<h3 id="org5e8875e">Splitting the key</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
EGPG manages all this with simple commands:
</p>
<pre class="example">
egpg key split [-d,--dongle &lt;dir&gt;] [-b,--backup &lt;dir&gt;]
    Split the key into 3 partial keys and store one of them on the
    dongle (removable device, usb), keep the other one locally,
    and use the third one as a backup. Afterwards, whenever the
    key needs to be used, the dongle has to be present.

egpg key join
    Join two partial keys into a full key and delete the partials.

egpg key recover &lt;backup-partial.key.xyz&gt;
    Recover the key from the backup partial key and from the
    partial key of the home or the dongle. This is useful when
    either the dongle or the home partial key is lost.
</pre></li>

</ul>

<section>
<section id="slide-orga21987d">
<h2 id="orga21987d">EGPG can work on any platform</h2>
<ul>
<li>The file <b>platform.sh</b> contains a couple of functions that can be
platform dependent.</li>
<li>The platform is detected automatically and these functions are
overridden with the right implementation for the current platform.</li>
<li>So, EGPG is flexible enough to potentially work on any platform.</li>

<h2 id="org662af56">EGPG criticism</h2>
<ul>
<li>The EGPG critics have expressed their concerns that since EGPG is
just a wrapper script to GPG, it is too fragile.</li>
<li>This is so because the GPG command line was meant to be an
interactive tool, not a streamline tool that can be easily
combined with other tools.</li>
<li>As such, its output format can change at any time, and even small
changes can break EGPG.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0dbda1a">
<h3 id="org0dbda1a">EGPG criticism</h3>
<ul>
<li>A possible defense argument can be that EGPG should be used only
with stable releases of Linux distributions, which by definition
don't change the major versions of their supported tools and
utilities and allow only for bug and security fixes.</li>
<li>So, the chances of EGPG being broken are small, and it needs to be
updated/fixed only for every next stable release (which does not
occur too frequently).</li>

<li>Nevertheless the problem still exists and the recommended solution
is to re-implement parts of EGPG with Python bindings of GPGME
(which is a library for doing GPG stuff).</li>

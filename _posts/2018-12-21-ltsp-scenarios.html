summary: LTSP allows computers of a LAN to boot through the network from
  a single server. The benefits of using it are reduced hardware costs and
  reduced time of maintenance (with the later one becoming more important
  over time, as hardware becomes cheaper). It has other benefits as well
  in administration and maintenance. In this article we will see different
  configuration and maintenance scenarios of a LTSP server.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">About LTSP</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
<a href="http://www.ltsp.org">LTSP</a> allows computers of a LAN to boot through the network from a
single server. The benefits of using it are reduced hardware costs and
reduced time of maintenance.
</p>

<p>
Hardware costs are reduced because the clients don't need to be
powerful, since everything (or almost everything) runs on the
server. They don't need to have a hard-disk and don't need to have
much RAM.
</p>

<p>
The time of maintenance is reduced because there is only the server to
be maintained, not 20-30 computers of the LAN. Installing new
software, updating, upgrading etc. is done only once on the server.
The reduced time of maintenance is becoming the most important benefit
of using LTSP, as hardware becomes cheaper.
</p>

<p>
Besides these, LTSP has other administration and communication
benefits. For example it provides centralized user accounts (a user
can login to his account from any terminal). Or screen/desktop sharing
(for example a teacher can show his desktop to the students for
demonstration, or can see what they are doing, and even help them
remotely).
</p>

<p>
In this article we will see different configuration and maintenance
scenarios of a LTSP server. These are based on my experience and on
the discussion made on the ltsp-discuss mailing list. It is by no
means a complete or thorough list of all the possible scenarios, so
any suggestions for adding new scenarios to this list would be
welcome.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Managing User Accounts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
User accounts are created and maintained on the server. Any command or
tool will do, but if there are lots of accounts, some bash scripts
would be useful for automating bulk operations. This is such a script:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/Virtual-LTSP/VirtualBox/blob/bionic/users.sh">https://gitlab.com/Virtual-LTSP/VirtualBox/blob/bionic/users.sh</a>
</p>

<p>
As shown also on its help, you can use it to create new accounts,
export, import, backup and restore user accounts and their home
directories:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Usage: ./users.sh [&lt;command&gt;] [&lt;filename&gt;]

Commands:

    create [&lt;user-file.txt&gt;]
        Create new user accounts. Each line of the input contains
        a username, unencrypted password, and details, separated by ':'.
        If no file is given than read from stdin.

    export
        Export to stdout username, encrypted password and details
        for all the users.

    import [&lt;user-file.passwd&gt;]
        Import usernames, encrypted passwords and details from the export file.
        If no file is given than read from stdin.

    backup
        Backup home directories and users (username:password:details).
        The backup archive is stored on the directory 'backup/'.

    restore &lt;backup-file.tgz&gt;
        Restore home directories and user accounts from the given backup file.
</pre>

<p>
If you have a Virtual-LTSP server (a LTSP server on VirtualBox, with
Vagrant), you have to login first to the server, for example like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd ltsp-server/
vagrant ssh
sudo su
cd /hosts/
./users.sh
</pre>

<p>
The backup files are usually stored on the directory <code>/hosts/backup/</code>,
which is a shared directory between the virtualbox machine and its
host. So, in case you have to rebuild the server (<code>./server.sh build</code>),
the backup will be available to the new server and you can restore it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Maintaining a Chrootless Client Image</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The defining feature of a <b>chrootless</b> client image is that there is no
<i>chroot</i> directory for its files. Instead, the LTSP server itself is
used as an example or template for the client image. This means that
if we want to update/upgrade or install new software on the client
image, we have to do this on the server itself, and then we have to
regenerate the image of the client (using the command
<code>ltsp-update-image --cleanup /</code>).
</p>

<p>
Sometimes there is a problem, because we want to install on the LTSP
server things that we don't want to run on the client (for example
apache2, mysql, guacamole, etc.).
</p>

<p>
A solution for this is to exclude from the image some of the
directories and services of the server. There are these options:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use the directive <code>RM_SYSTEM_SERVICES</code> on
<code>/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/lts.conf</code> to disable some services even
if they are installed on the client.
</li>
<li>Use the directive <code>EXCLUDE</code> on <code>/etc/ltsp/ltsp-build-client.conf</code> to
uninstall some packages from the finished chroot.
</li>
<li>Add lines like <code>etc/apache2/</code> on <code>/etc/ltsp/ltsp-update-image.excludes</code>
  to exclude certain directories from the image.
</li>
<li>Use the option <code>--exclude</code> of the command <code>ltsp-update-image</code> to exclude
certain directories from the image.
</li>
<li>Create a shell script like <code>/etc/ltsp/cleanup.d/60-cleanup</code> which is
executed inside the chroot before generating the image from it. In
this script you can uninstall packages, remove directories, etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Another approach, which is simpler and cleaner (in my opinion), is to
unpack the client image into a directory, chroot into it, make any
necessary maintenance (update, upgrade, install etc.), then generate
again the client image from this <i>chroot</i> directory. This essentially
converts it into a <b>chroot</b> client image, but that's OK.
</p>

<p>
It can be done like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
unsquashfs -d /opt/ltsp/i386 /opt/ltsp/images/i386.img
rm /opt/ltsp/i386/etc/resolv.conf
ltsp-chroot -mr

apt update
apt upgrade
apt install joe jove
exit    # from chroot

ltsp-update-image
systemctl restart nbd-server
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Creating Guest Accounts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
In public computers (e.g. in schools, libraries, universities, etc.)
sometimes it is useful to have guest accounts. This means that the
content of the account is temporary and is erased immediately after
logout (or on login). This is important because it reverts
automatically all the default settings, no matter how much the users
mess with them, therefore minimizing the need for maintenance. It is
also important for the safety of the users, because it ensures that no
open accounts or passwords are left behind.
</p>

<p>
The approach used in LTSP for creating guest accounts is to create
a user for each different IP, and to reset the content of the home
of this user when he makes a login. It is described on these posts:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/ltsp/mailman/message/27814821/">https://sourceforge.net/p/ltsp/mailman/message/27814821/</a>
</li>

</li>
<li><a href="http://www.m-opensolutions.com/?p=667">http://www.m-opensolutions.com/?p=667</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We need to add these directives on <code>lts.conf</code> in order to enable the
guest login button:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[Default]
LDM_GUESTLOGIN=True
HOSTNAME_BASE="$hostname"
#LDM_AUTOLOGIN=True
</pre>

<p>
This script (which should work on any Ubuntu <i>bionic</i> LTSP server) can
be used to create and configure automatically guest accounts:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/Virtual-LTSP/VirtualBox/blob/bionic/ltsp-server/scripts/create-guest-accounts.sh">https://gitlab.com/Virtual-LTSP/VirtualBox/blob/bionic/ltsp-server/scripts/create-guest-accounts.sh</a>
</p>

<pre class="example">
#!/bin/bash -x
### Create and config guest accounts.

guest=${1:-guest}
pass=${2:-pass}
hostname=${3:-ltsp}

# create the template/skeleton guest account
groupadd guest --gid=500 -f
adduser $guest --uid=500 --gid=500 \
        --shell=/bin/bash --gecos '' \
        --disabled-password
usermod $guest --password="$(openssl passwd -stdin &lt;&lt;&lt; $pass)"
chown $guest:guest -R /home/$guest

# create the guest accounts
rm -rf /home/guest-accounts/
mkdir -p /home/guest-accounts/
for ip in {1..255}; do
    user="${hostname}${ip}"
    adduser $user --uid=$((500 + $ip)) --gid=500 \
            --home=/home/guest-accounts/$user \
            --shell=/bin/bash --gecos '' \
            --disabled-password
    usermod $user --password="$(openssl passwd -stdin &lt;&lt;&lt; $user)"
done

# create a script that resets a guest account
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /usr/local/bin/reset-guest-account.sh
#!/bin/bash
user=\$SUDO_USER
[[ \$user =~ ^'$hostname'[0-9]{1,3}\$ ]] || exit 1
cd /home/guest-accounts/\$user || exit 2
rm -rf .* *
rsync -a /home/$guest/ .
chown \$user -R .
EOF
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/reset-guest-account.sh

# allow users of group 'guest' to call the reset script with sudo
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/reset-guest-account
# users of group 'guest' can call the reset script without password
%guest  ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/reset-guest-account.sh
EOF

# make sure guest accounts are reset on login
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /usr/share/ldm/rc.d/S00-guest-sessions
# if username matches the pattern of a guest account
# then call the script that resets the account
echo \$LDM_USERNAME | grep -E '^$hostname[0-9]{1,3}\$' \\
    &amp;&amp; ssh -S "\$LDM_SOCKET" "\$LDM_SERVER" 'sudo /usr/local/bin/reset-guest-account.sh'
EOF

### place some limits on guest accounts
sed -i /etc/security/limits.conf -e '/^### custom/,$ d'
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; /etc/security/limits.conf
### custom
@guest        hard    nproc           1000
 *             hard    core            0
@guest        hard    cpu             2
@guest        hard    maxlogins       1
EOF
</pre>

<p>
Guest accounts are reset on each login, which means that the home
directory is erased and is replaced with the content of the home
directory of the account <b>guest</b>. As a result, by customizing the
account <b>guest</b> (for example changing the background) we actually
customize all the guest accounts.
</p>

</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Desktop Configuration For New Users</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Sometimes we want to customize the default desktop configuration of
the users (for example change the background, add some apps on desktop
or panel, etc.)
</p>

<p>
An approach that works for MATE, Gnome, Firefox, etc. is to override
the settings (search on google for "default settings" or "mandatory
settings").  For MATE, you can make your own override file for all
users, like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
vi /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/60_myown.gschema.override
sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
</pre>

<p>
The override file looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[org.mate.panel]
default-layout='redmond'

[org.mate.marco]
button-layout='menu:minimize,maximize,close'
theme='TraditionalOk'
num-workspaces=4

[org.mate.panel.objects.window-list.prefs]
group-windows='auto'
display-all-workspaces=true
move-unminimized-windows=false
</pre>

<p>
Here is an example:
<a href="https://git.launchpad.net/sch-scripts/tree/debian/sch-scripts.gsettings-override">https://git.launchpad.net/sch-scripts/tree/debian/sch-scripts.gsettings-override</a>
</p>

<p>
Another approach is to create a skeleton user account, for example
<b>skel</b>, then to make a symbolic link from <code>/etc/skel</code> to <code>/home/skel</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
mv /etc/skel /etc/skel.bak
ln -s /home/skel /etc/skel
</pre>
<p>
The configurations that you make to the <b>skel</b> user will be applied
automatically to the new user accounts that are created.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Be careful with this approach. If some applets don't save the
paths to user home directories relatively, this may lead to
confusion. In this case you should remove these applets and try to
configure them the other way (described above).
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Reverting User Accounts to Default Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
It is often useful to revert all the settings of user accounts to
default values, except for the files that they have saved, Firefox
bookmarks, etc.  This minimizes the maintenance time for user
accounts, while allowing the users to play with changing the
preferences and other configuration settings, etc.
</p>

<p>
It can be done by creating the script
<code>/opt/ltsp/i386/usr/share/ldm/rc.d/S01-user-sessions</code> with a content
like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
case "$LDM_USERNAME" in
    user*)
        sh -S "$LDM_SOCKET" "$LDM_SERVER" "cd; find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \
            -name '.*' -delete; rsync -a /etc/skel/ ."
        ;;
esac
</pre>

<p>
If you have a <b>chrootless</b> client image, then this script should be
saved on the file <code>/usr/share/ldm/rc.d/S01-user-sessions</code> .
</p>

<p>
The next step is to run <code>ltsp-update-image</code> (or <code>ltsp-update-image
--cleanup /</code> for chrootless image).
</p>

<p>
If we wanted to use a configuration script like that of guest accounts
it would be like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/bash -x

# create a script that resets a user account
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /usr/local/bin/reset-user-account.sh
#!/bin/bash
user=\$SUDO_USER
[[ \$user =~ ^user.*\$ ]] || exit 1
cd /home/\$user || exit 2
find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -name '.*' -delete
rsync -a /etc/skel/ .
chown \$user: -R .
EOF
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/reset-user-account.sh

# allow users of group 'student' to call the reset script with sudo
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/reset-user-account
# users of group 'user' can call the reset script without password
%user  ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/reset-user-account.sh
EOF

# make sure user accounts are reset on login
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /usr/share/ldm/rc.d/S01-user-sessions
# if username matches the pattern of a user account
# then call the script that resets the account
echo \$LDM_USERNAME | grep -E '^user.*\$' \\
    &amp;&amp; ssh -S "\$LDM_SOCKET" "\$LDM_SERVER" 'sudo /usr/local/bin/reset-user-account.sh'
EOF
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">Allow Teacher To Use Epoptes From a Fat Client</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Usually the teacher has access to the desktop of the LTSP server and
can launch Epoptes user interface there. It is important that the
Epoptes UI is launched on the LTSP server, because the Epoptes daemon
is running there.
</p>

<p>
However, sometimes may not be possible to access the desktop of the
LTSP server. In this case, it is possible to launch Epoptes from a fat
client too. This can be done by using remote apps (which means that
the apps run on the server and their display is on the client). Add
these lines on <code>/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/lts.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[Default]
    REMOTE_APPS=True
    RCFILE_01="sed 's,^Exec=/usr/bin/epoptes,Exec=ltsp-remoteapps dbus-launch epoptes,' -i /usr/share/applications/epoptes.desktop"
</pre>

<p>
Now you can login on a fat client and run this on the terminal:
<code>ltsp-remoteapps dbus-launch epoptes</code>
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Make sure that the user of the teacher is a member of the
<b>epoptes</b> group.
</p>

<p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Allow Users To Change The Password From a Fat Client</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Since user accounts live on the server, usually it is not possible to
change the password from the client. The only way is to ssh to the
server and to change it there, or to run a remote application (meaning
that the application runs on the server) that can change the password.
</p>

<p>
From the terminal it can be done like this: <code>ssh -t server passwd</code>
(which runs the command <code>passwd</code> on the server). This may be a bit
confusing because it requires twice the current password, before
asking for the new password.
</p>

<p>
Another way that is nicer, is to set <code>REMOTE_APPS=True</code> in
<code>/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/amd64/lts.conf</code> (or
<code>/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/lts.conf</code>). Then you can run from the
client something like this: <code>ltsp-remote-apps xfce4-terminal -e passwd</code>
</p>

<p>
It is even nicer if you can create this alias (for example in <code>.bashrc</code>
of the users):
</p>
<pre class="example">
alias passwd='ltsp-remote-apps xfce4-terminal -e passwd'
</pre>
<p>
Instead of <code>passwd</code>, you may also call a bash script on the server,
which makes the interaction with the user nicer.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to allow users to change the password by using a
GUI application.  You can do something like what is described here for
Epoptes: <a href="http://www.epoptes.org/documentation/fat-clients">http://www.epoptes.org/documentation/fat-clients</a> Instead of
<code>epoptes</code> you can do it for <code>gnome-about-me</code> or <code>mate-about-me</code> (or whatever
works on your desktop) and then your users will be able to change
their passwords from the menu, without requiring the terminal or any
other weird things.

<h2 id="sec-9">Remote Thin/Fat Client Access for Maintenance or Debugging</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Sometimes it is not possible (or feasible) to access physically the
LTSP server and the clients for maintenance or debugging. In this case
you can access the desktop of the LTSP server remotely. This can be
done by:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>X2Go (<a href="https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php">https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php</a>)
</li>
<li>Epoptes (<a href="http://www.epoptes.org">http://www.epoptes.org</a>) "remote assistance" feature
(i.e. reverse VNC)
</li>
<li>VNC and ssh tunneling (<a href="http://dashohoxha.fs.al/sshtunnels/">http://dashohoxha.fs.al/sshtunnels/</a>)
</li>
<li>Guacamole
(<a href="https://gitlab.com/Virtual-LTSP/VirtualBox/blob/bionic/ltsp-server/scripts/guacamole.sh">https://gitlab.com/Virtual-LTSP/VirtualBox/blob/bionic/ltsp-server/scripts/guacamole.sh</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you are able to access the desktop of the LTSP server remotely,
you can access the desktop of the clients as well, through the Epoptes
"remote control" feature.
</p>

<p>
You can also boot up clients remotely from Epoptes, if you have them
organized in groups (see:
<a href="http://www.epoptes.org/documentation/groups">http://www.epoptes.org/documentation/groups</a>).  However, for this to
work, WoL (Wake on LAN) has to be enabled on the client BIOS/UEFI.
</p>

<p>
If you want to check also the boot messages on the client, you can do
it with a virtual machine. For example if you install VirtualBox on
the LTSP server, then you can start a VirtualBox LTSP client with a
script like this:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/Virtual-LTSP/VirtualBox/blob/bionic/client.sh">https://gitlab.com/Virtual-LTSP/VirtualBox/blob/bionic/client.sh</a> A
VirtualBox client may not be exactly the same as a real client (in
terms of hardware etc.), but it is better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
Instead of a VirtualBox machine, you can use a KVM virtual machine as
well. It should be configured to boot in PXE and the KVM server must
be in same subnet as your LTSP clients. Than you can have a QEMU+SSH
connection using virt-manager, which gives you a graphical access to
the VM.

<div id="outline-container-sec-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10">Running Two LTSP Servers on The Same LAN</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
This may be useful for example when you already have an old server
running (lets say based on Ubuntu-16.04), and you want to install and
configure a new one (based on Ubuntu-18.04). You can't shutdown or
throw away the old one, until the new one is prepared and tested.
</p>

<p>
The most easy way is to avoid running them simultaneously (at the same
time), especially when the DHCP server is inside the LTSP server
itself. In this case you have to do the installation and testing of
the new server when the classroom is not being used (so that you can
shut down the old server and boot up the new one).
</p>

<p>
However, if you make special configurations for each client on the
DHCP server (based on the MAC addresses of the clients), it is
possible to tell some of them to boot from one LTSP server, and the
others to boot from the other. Then both of the LTSP servers (or all
of them, if there are more than two) can run simultaneously, without
stepping on the toes of each-other.
</p>

<p>
This kind of configuration (running simultaneously multiple LTSP
servers on the same LAN, each one with its own clients) might be
useful also on cases when you have different kinds of clients on the
LAN, which have different requirements, so you use different servers
to serve them. However, it is better, in general, to build different
client images on the same LTSP server, and to serve them to different
clients based on the clients' MAC addresses.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-11">Having Home Directories on a Separate Server</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
If you run more than one LTSP server on the same LAN simultaneously,
it is useful to keep all the user accounts and home directories on the
same server. This means that for at least one of the LTSP servers, the
user accounts will have to be accessed from another server (a different
server than the one that serves the system image).
</p>

<p>
This can be done by using the directive <code>LDM_SERVER=10.11.12.13</code> in
<code>lts.conf</code>, which means "use this server for authentication and
/home". It is an easy way to separate the authentication/home server,
from the NBD server which serves <code>/</code> (the root filesystem).
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, <code>/home</code> can also be shared via NFS with a directive like
this on <code>lts.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
FSTAB_1="server:/home /home nfs defaults,nolock 0 0"
</pre>
<p>
Instead of <code>server</code> (which is a name for the LTSP server) you can use
any other server, for example <code>10.11.12.13</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Using separate servers for the system image and for home
directories, implicitly does a bit of load balancing as well.
